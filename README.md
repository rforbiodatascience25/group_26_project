Welcome to **group 26's project repo**!

In this project we are going to examine global tuberculosis (TB) cases. <br><br>
Link to the data: <br>
https://www.who.int/teams/global-programme-on-tuberculosis-and-lung-health/data
<br>
<br>
The dataset originates from WHO's (World Health Organization) 2025 TB report. 
<br>
<br>
We will be working with the 4 datasets under "WHO TB burden estimates" (follow the link above).
- WHO TB burden estimates [>1Mb]
- WHO TB incidence estimates disaggregated by age group, sex and risk factor [>0.5Mb]
- WHO MDR/RR-TB burden estimates
- WHO TB infection estimates in household contacts

(Almost a perfect split for each group member to work with!)

The dataset is raw, and as you will soon see, each of them contains a decent degree of "dirt". <br>
Each of the 4 datasets contains different metadata regarding global TB cases. 

The goal of this project is to shed some light on some of the general trends associated with worldwide TB cases. <br>
The project aims at identifying particularly vulnerable demographic and geographic groups, etc. 

The resulting data analysis should be something which could, hypothetically, 
be presented to governments or healthcare workers in order to aid them in their decision-making and health care strategies.

<br>
<br>
Generative AI (ChatGPT) was used in creating this project. <br>

**Explicit uses**
- Finding a suitable dataset that aligned with the authors' interests. <br>
- Providing explanations about the raw dataset. <br>
- Bug fixing. <br>
- Suggesting code improvements. <br>
- Generating Tidyverse R code (in alignment with the course style and curriculum). <br>
<br>

**Responsibility**
<br>
We hereby acknowledge that all facts, decisions, and ideas provided by the LLMs were used to guide our writing process, and all decisions regarding the content of the project are entirely our own. <br>
Furthermore, we acknowledge and have considered that generative AI can hinder the active learning process when it is blindly used as an "answer machine" instead of a "sparing partner". <br>

The AI was only used to ask question providing an answer to it at the same time. This was done to check if my knowledge is enough or if I should know something else that I'm not taking in consideration. <br>
Other than that, I used it for minor bugs to check why some mistakes were occurring, like an extra symbol or why a function was not working as intended. <br>
