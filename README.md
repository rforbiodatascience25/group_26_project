Welcome to group 26's project repo!

In this project we are going to examine global tuberculosis (TB) cases.
Link to the data: 
https://www.who.int/teams/global-programme-on-tuberculosis-and-lung-health/data

The dataset originates WHO's (World Health Organization) 2025 TB report. 

We will be working with the 4 datasets under "WHO TB burden estimates" (follow the link above).
- WHO TB burden estimates [>1Mb]
- WHO TB incidence estimates disaggregated by age group, sex and risk factor [>0.5Mb]
- WHO MDR/RR-TB burden estimates
- WHO TB infection estimates in household contacts

(Almost a perfect split for each group member to work with!)

The dataset is raw, and as you will soon see, each of them contains a decent degree of "dirt". 
Each of the 4 datasets contains different metadata regarding global TB cases. 

The goal of this project is to shed some light on some of the general trends associated with world-wide TB cases.
The project aims at identifying of particularly vulnerable demographic and geographic groups, etc. 

The resulting data analysis should be something which could, hypothetically, 
be presented to governments or healthcare workers in order to aid them in their decision making and health care strategies.
